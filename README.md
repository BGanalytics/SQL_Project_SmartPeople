# SQL_Project_SmartPeople
Creating multiple data tables in SQL, then drawing information by combining data

Challenge: Data regarding smart people on the planet can be found in three separate tables. Table 1 contains the name, age and nationality of 6 smart people. Table 2 contains their jobs, with a reference name id, and Table 3 shows smart people in the same fields using only name id's and not real names. We need a table that is readable and easy to understand, to know which fields were common between the selected smart people. 

My approach: Using Join to merge data from the first two tables so that we have people information and their jobs in the same table. 
Then joining this table with Table 3 to replace name id's with real names. This way we create a table that contains real names, matches the smart people in the same field and also shows which fields they were matched for.
